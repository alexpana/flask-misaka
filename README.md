A simple Flask extension to integrate the [Misaka](http://misaka.61924.nl)
module, which is a Python interface to the excellent
[Sundown](https://github.com/vmg/sundown) markdown-parsing library.

The full documentation for this project is built using Sphinx; you can also
check out [a pre-built version hosted on RTD](https://flask-misaka.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
